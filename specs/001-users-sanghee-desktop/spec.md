**Feature Branch**: `001-users-sanghee-desktop`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "error-logger-sendSMS Ìï¥ÏÑú discord or slackÏúºÎ°ú DBÏó∞Í≤∞ ÏóÜÏù¥ Îã®ÏàúÌïòÍ≤å slackÏù¥ÎÇò discordÎ°ú Î≥¥ÎÇ¥Îäî Í∏∞Îä•ÏùÑ npmÏúºÎ°ú Ìå®ÌÇ§ÏßïÌôî ÌïòÎäî ÌîÑÎ°úÏ†ùÌä∏Î•º ÎßåÎì§Í≥† Ïã∂Ïñ¥"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Error logging with Discord/Slack notifications without database
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, Applications
   ‚Üí Actions: Send error notifications to Discord/Slack
   ‚Üí Data: Error messages, metadata
   ‚Üí Constraints: No database dependency, simple npm package
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Error occurs ‚Üí Send notification to Discord/Slack
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (error data, notification config)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Implementation details avoided
   ‚Üí Focus on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to send error notifications directly to Discord or Slack channels without setting up a database, so that I can quickly monitor application errors and respond to issues in real-time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an application with error-logger-sendSMS configured, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the error details are sent to the configured Discord/Slack channel
2. **Given** a developer wants to monitor different error levels, **When** they configure different notification channels, **Then** errors are routed to appropriate channels based on severity
3. **Given** an application is running in different environments, **When** errors occur, **Then** notifications include environment context to help with debugging
4. **Given** a notification fails to send, **When** the retry mechanism is triggered, **Then** the system attempts to deliver the notification with exponential backoff

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Discord/Slack webhook URLs are invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from Discord/Slack APIs?
- What happens when the application is offline or network connectivity is lost?
- How does the system handle sensitive data in error messages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST send error notifications to Discord webhook URLs
- **FR-002**: System MUST send error notifications to Slack webhook URLs
- **FR-003**: System MUST support different error severity levels (error, warning, info)
- **FR-004**: System MUST include error context (timestamp, stack trace, metadata) in notifications
- **FR-005**: System MUST support environment-specific configuration (development, production, test)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide retry mechanism for failed notifications
- **FR-007**: System MUST sanitize sensitive data before sending notifications
- **FR-008**: System MUST support custom message formatting for Discord/Slack
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow runtime configuration changes without restart
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide fallback mechanisms when primary notification channel fails

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Performance - System MUST send notifications within 5 seconds of error occurrence
- **NFR-002**: Reliability - System MUST implement exponential backoff retry strategy (max 3 attempts)
- **NFR-003**: Privacy - System MUST sanitize passwords, tokens, and PII from error messages
- **NFR-004**: Testability - All notification features MUST have corresponding test scenarios
- **NFR-005**: Scalability - System MUST handle up to 1000 error notifications per minute
- **NFR-006**: Configuration - System MUST provide sensible defaults for all configuration options

### Clarifications Needed
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification frequency limits not specified - should there be rate limiting per channel?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain error data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - how long should error data be kept in memory before sending?]

### Key Entities
- **ErrorNotification**: Represents an error event with message, severity, timestamp, stack trace, and metadata
- **NotificationConfig**: Represents configuration for Discord/Slack channels including webhook URLs, formatting options, and environment settings
- **RetryPolicy**: Represents retry configuration including max attempts, backoff strategy, and failure handling
