# Implementation Plan: Error Logger SendSMS

**Branch**: `001-users-sanghee-desktop` | **Date**: 2025-10-04 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/sanghee/Desktop/project2/sendErrorMessage/specs/001-users-sanghee-desktop/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ Detect Project Type: npm package (single)
   → ✅ Set Structure Decision: Single project structure
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document
   → ✅ All constitutional principles evaluated
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ All checks pass: No violations detected
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved through research
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   → ✅ Ready to generate Phase 1 artifacts
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ No new violations: Design maintains constitutional principles
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → ✅ Task generation strategy documented
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 9. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a lightweight npm package that provides Sentry-style error logging with direct Discord/Slack notifications, eliminating database dependencies while maintaining robust error handling and notification delivery. The package will support retry mechanisms, data sanitization, and environment-aware configuration.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ (strict mode enabled)
**Primary Dependencies**: axios (HTTP client), @types/node (Node.js types)
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory only, no persistence)
**Testing**: Vitest (unit and integration tests)
**Target Platform**: Node.js 16+, Browser (ES modules)
**Project Type**: single (npm package)
**Performance Goals**: <5s notification delivery, <100ms initialization time
**Constraints**: <10MB package size, zero database dependencies, <200ms API response time
**Scale/Scope**: 1000 notifications/minute, single application instance

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Reliability First
- [x] All error handling paths include fallback mechanisms (retry with exponential backoff)
- [x] No silent failures in critical code paths (all errors logged to console as fallback)
- [x] Graceful degradation strategy documented (fallback to console logging when webhooks fail)

### Privacy by Design
- [x] Sensitive data sanitization identified and implemented (automatic PII/token removal)
- [x] No PII, passwords, or tokens in logs (sanitization utility)
- [x] Data handling reviewed for compliance (no data persistence, webhook-only transmission)

### Test-First Development
- [x] Tests written before implementation (TDD approach)
- [x] TDD cycle enforced (Red-Green-Refactor)
- [x] Code coverage target: 85%+

### Minimal Configuration
- [x] Sensible defaults provided for all options (environment detection, retry policies)
- [x] New config options justified or eliminated (only essential configuration exposed)
- [x] API simplicity validated (Sentry-like API for familiarity)

### Performance Conscious
- [x] Latency requirements specified (<5s notification delivery, <100ms init)
- [x] Memory footprint considered (<10MB package size)
- [x] Performance benchmarks planned (notification delivery time, initialization time)

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure chosen for npm package simplicity. All source code in `src/` with clear separation of concerns through subdirectories for providers, configuration, and utilities. This aligns with the constitutional principle of simplicity and maintains clear module boundaries.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Discord webhook API best practices and rate limits
   - Slack webhook API best practices and rate limits
   - Data sanitization patterns for error messages
   - Retry strategies for webhook failures
   - Environment detection in Node.js and browser contexts
   - Rate limiting strategy per channel (from FR-011 clarification)
   - In-memory data retention before sending (from FR-012 clarification)

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Discord webhook API for error notifications"
   Task: "Research Slack webhook API for error notifications"
   Task: "Find best practices for data sanitization in error logging"
   Task: "Research exponential backoff retry patterns for webhooks"
   Task: "Find environment detection patterns for Node.js/browser"
   Task: "Research rate limiting strategies for webhook notifications"
   Task: "Research in-memory queuing patterns for notification systems"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - ErrorNotification: message, severity, timestamp, stack, metadata, environment
   - NotificationConfig: webhook URLs (Discord/Slack), formatting options, retry settings
   - RetryPolicy: max attempts, backoff strategy, jitter, failure handling
   - SanitizationConfig: enabled flag, custom patterns, default patterns

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - ErrorLogger.captureException() → Discord/Slack webhook calls
   - ErrorLogger.captureMessage() → Discord/Slack webhook calls
   - ErrorLogger.configure() → Runtime configuration updates
   - ErrorLogger.setEnvironment() → Environment context setting
   - Output TypeScript interfaces to `contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - ErrorLogger initialization tests
   - Notification delivery tests (Discord/Slack)
   - Configuration validation tests
   - Retry mechanism tests
   - Sanitization tests
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Error notification delivery → Integration test scenarios
   - Multi-channel routing (severity-based) → Integration tests
   - Environment context inclusion → Integration tests
   - Retry on failure → Integration tests
   - Quickstart scenarios → Validation tests

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Add TypeScript, Node.js, webhook integration context
   - Include Discord/Slack API patterns
   - Add error logging and notification patterns
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root as `CLAUDE.md`

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/*.ts, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each provider → provider implementation task [P]
- Each utility (sanitizer, retry, formatter) → utility implementation task [P]
- Each configuration module → configuration task [P]
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- Documentation and examples

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Types → Utils → Providers → Main class
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Contract tests before implementation
- Integration tests after core implementation

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations detected - all constitutional principles maintained. The design:
- Maintains reliability through retry mechanisms and console fallbacks
- Ensures privacy through automatic data sanitization
- Enforces TDD with contract tests before implementation
- Provides minimal configuration with sensible defaults
- Meets performance requirements with <5s delivery and <10MB size

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command) - 54 tasks created
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
