## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to send error notifications directly to Discord or Slack channels without setting up a database, so that I can quickly monitor application errors and respond to issues in real-time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an application with error-logger-sendSMS configured, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the error details are sent to the configured Discord/Slack channel
2. **Given** a developer wants to monitor different error levels, **When** they configure different notification channels, **Then** errors are routed to appropriate channels based on severity
3. **Given** an application is running in different environments, **When** errors occur, **Then** notifications include environment context to help with debugging
4. **Given** a notification fails to send, **When** the retry mechanism is triggered, **Then** the system attempts to deliver the notification with exponential backoff

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Discord/Slack webhook URLs are invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from Discord/Slack APIs?
- What happens when the application is offline or network connectivity is lost?
- How does the system handle sensitive data in error messages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST send error notifications to Discord webhook URLs
- **FR-002**: System MUST send error notifications to Slack webhook URLs
- **FR-003**: System MUST support different error severity levels (error, warning, info)
- **FR-004**: System MUST include error context (timestamp, stack trace, metadata) in notifications
- **FR-005**: System MUST support environment-specific configuration (development, production, test)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide retry mechanism for failed notifications
- **FR-007**: System MUST sanitize sensitive data before sending notifications
- **FR-008**: System MUST support custom message formatting for Discord/Slack
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow runtime configuration changes without restart
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide fallback mechanisms when primary notification channel fails

### Non-Functional Requirements *(include if applicable)*
- **NFR-001**: Performance - System MUST send notifications within 5 seconds of error occurrence
- **NFR-002**: Reliability - System MUST implement exponential backoff retry strategy (max 3 attempts)
- **NFR-003**: Privacy - System MUST sanitize passwords, tokens, and PII from error messages
- **NFR-004**: Testability - All notification features MUST have corresponding test scenarios
- **NFR-005**: Scalability - System MUST handle up to 1000 error notifications per minute
- **NFR-006**: Configuration - System MUST provide sensible defaults for all configuration options

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification frequency limits not specified - should there be rate limiting per channel?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain error data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - how long should error data be kept in memory?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ErrorNotification**: Represents an error event with message, severity, timestamp, stack trace, and metadata
- **NotificationConfig**: Represents configuration for Discord/Slack channels including webhook URLs, formatting options, and environment settings
- **RetryPolicy**: Represents retry configuration including max attempts, backoff strategy, and failure handling

## Project Overview

### What We're Building
A lightweight npm package that provides Sentry-style error logging capabilities with direct Discord and Slack notification support. Unlike traditional error logging solutions that require database setup, this package focuses on simplicity and immediate notification delivery.

### Why This Matters
- **Immediate Response**: Developers get instant notifications when errors occur, enabling faster issue resolution
- **Zero Infrastructure**: No database setup required, reducing deployment complexity
- **Team Collaboration**: Direct integration with team communication channels (Discord/Slack)
- **Environment Awareness**: Contextual notifications help developers understand where issues occur
- **Minimal Configuration**: Sensible defaults allow quick setup with minimal configuration

### Key Differentiators
1. **Database-Free**: Unlike supabase-error-logger, this package doesn't require any database setup
2. **Direct Notifications**: Errors are sent directly to team channels instead of being stored first
3. **Multi-Platform**: Supports both Discord and Slack with unified API
4. **Environment Context**: Automatically includes environment information in notifications
5. **Retry Logic**: Built-in resilience for network issues and API rate limits

### Target Users
- **Frontend Developers**: Quick error monitoring for React, Vue, Angular applications
- **Backend Developers**: API error notifications for Node.js, Python, Go services
- **DevOps Teams**: Infrastructure monitoring without complex logging setups
- **Small Teams**: Teams that want error monitoring without enterprise logging solutions

### Success Metrics
- Package installation and configuration time < 5 minutes
- Error notification delivery time < 5 seconds
- Zero database dependencies
- Support for both Discord and Slack platforms
- 99% notification delivery success rate (with retries)

## Technical Approach Summary

### Core Architecture
The package will follow a similar pattern to supabase-error-logger but replace database operations with HTTP webhook calls to Discord/Slack APIs. The main components will be:

1. **ErrorLogger Class**: Main interface similar to SupabaseErrorLogger
2. **Notification Providers**: Discord and Slack webhook implementations
3. **Configuration Management**: Environment-aware configuration system
4. **Retry Mechanism**: Exponential backoff for failed notifications
5. **Data Sanitization**: Automatic removal of sensitive information

### Integration Points
- **Discord Webhooks**: Direct integration with Discord channel webhooks
- **Slack Webhooks**: Direct integration with Slack incoming webhooks
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic detection of development/production environments
- **Error Context**: Automatic capture of stack traces, timestamps, and metadata

### Package Structure
```
error-logger-sendSMS/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts              # Main ErrorLogger class
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/            # Discord/Slack providers
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/               # Configuration management
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                 # Utilities (sanitization, retry)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                     # TypeScript definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                     # Test suite
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/                  # Usage examples
```

This approach ensures the package is simple to use while providing robust error notification capabilities without any database dependencies.
