# Supabase Error Logger Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Reliability First
Error logging MUST never fail silently. All error capture paths MUST implement
fallback mechanisms to ensure data integrity. When the primary logging path fails,
the system MUST degrade gracefully through backup mechanisms (console logging,
local storage, queuing).

**Rationale**: Missing error data fundamentally compromises debugging capability
and system observability. Silent failures in error logging create blind spots
that can mask critical production issues.

**Impact**: All error paths require explicit failure handling. Code reviews MUST
verify fallback mechanisms exist.

### II. Privacy by Design
No sensitive user data MUST appear in error logs. All error data MUST be sanitized
before transmission to prevent exposure of passwords, tokens, personally identifiable
information (PII), or other sensitive content.

**Rationale**: Compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA) and user trust mandate that
logging systems cannot become attack vectors for data exposure.

**Impact**: Sanitization logic required before all logging operations. Security
reviews MUST validate data handling patterns.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation. The TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
is strictly enforced: write failing tests, implement minimal code to pass, then
refactor.

**Rationale**: Test-first development ensures testability, reduces defects, and
creates living documentation of expected behavior. Pre-written tests prevent
scope creep and maintain focus.

**Impact**: Pull requests without failing tests first will be rejected. Code
coverage MUST be maintained above 85%.

### IV. Minimal Configuration
The library MUST work with minimal configuration. Sensible defaults MUST be
provided for all optional settings. Complex configuration indicates poor API
design.

**Rationale**: Developer experience suffers when configuration becomes a barrier
to adoption. Simplicity reduces support burden and integration friction.

**Impact**: New configuration options require justification. API design reviews
MUST evaluate if new options can be eliminated through better defaults.

### V. Performance Conscious
Error logging MUST impose minimal overhead on host applications. Maximum latency
per log operation: 100ms p95. Memory footprint MUST remain under 10MB for typical
usage patterns.

**Rationale**: Error logging is defensive infrastructure that must not degrade
application performance. Logging overhead that impacts user experience defeats
the purpose.

**Impact**: Performance benchmarks required for all changes touching the logging
path. PRs introducing performance regressions will be rejected.

## Development Standards

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ compatibility required
- **Backend**: Supabase (via @supabase/supabase-js ^2.0.0)
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit and integration tests
- **Build**: TypeScript compiler with declaration files

### Code Quality
- Type safety MUST be enforced (no `any` types without explicit justification)
- All public APIs MUST have TypeScript documentation comments
- Exported functions MUST include usage examples in comments
- Cyclomatic complexity MUST remain under 10 per function
- Functions MUST do one thing and do it well (single responsibility)

### Error Handling
- Never swallow exceptions silently
- Log errors to console when primary logging fails
- Provide actionable error messages to developers
- Include context in error messages (operation attempted, input state)

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 85% code coverage for all non-trivial code paths
- Contract tests MUST verify Supabase integration points
- Integration tests MUST validate end-to-end logging flows
- Unit tests MUST cover edge cases (network failures, invalid input, quota limits)
- Performance tests MUST validate latency requirements

### Test Organization
- Contract tests: `tests/contract/` - verify external API contracts
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` - verify complete workflows
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/` - verify isolated component behavior
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/` - verify latency/throughput goals

### Documentation
- README MUST include installation, quickstart, and API reference
- All exported classes/functions MUST have JSDoc comments
- Breaking changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Migration guides MUST be provided for major version bumps

## Governance

### Amendment Process
1. Propose constitutional change via GitHub issue
2. Document rationale and impact analysis
3. Obtain approval from project maintainer
4. Update dependent templates (plan, spec, tasks)
5. Increment constitution version according to rules below
6. Merge with comprehensive change documentation

### Versioning Policy
Constitution follows semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking governance changes, principle removals/redefinitions
- **MINOR**: New principles added, significant guidance expansions
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic fixes

### Compliance Review
- All pull requests MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles
- Code reviews MUST reference relevant principles when providing feedback
- Complexity additions MUST be justified against simplicity principles
- Use `.specify/memory/constitution.md` as canonical governance reference
- Violations require documented justification or alternative approach
